Skateboarding is not just a sport. A means of getting around. A nuisance in neighbourhoods. It is, to me, a form of expression. <br>

Here are some quick facts:

	<li>In 2016, it was announced that skateboarding will be represented at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.</li>
	<li>The first skateboards started with wooden boxes, or boards, with roller skate wheels attached to the bottom.</li>
	<li>The first manufactured skateboards were ordered by a Los Angeles, California surf shop, meant to be used by surfers in their downtime. Accordingly, skateboarding was originally denoted "sidewalk surfing" and early skaters emulated surfing style and maneuvers, and performed barefoot.</li>
<blockquote style="font-size:100%;">"Today's skateboarders are founders in this sport-they're pioneers-they are the first. There is no history in Skateboarding-its being made 
now-by you. The sport is being molded and we believe that doing the right thing now will lead to a bright future for the sport. 
Already, there are storm clouds on the horizon with opponents of the sport talking about ban and restriction."</blockquote>
-John Severson, publisher of <b>'The Quarterly Skateboarder'</b>, the first skateboarding magazine<br>

<h2 style="font-size:90px"><u>Types of skateboards</u></h2>

</style>
	<li style="font-family:Bungee Inline">Mini Boards.</li> 
	<img src="Mini.png" alt="Mini Board" width="300" height="250"><br>
	Mini Boards were the most common type of boards when skateboarding began. They are small skateboards that are to perform tricks and stunts with in the park or
	just your backyard.
	<li style="font-family:Bungee Inline">Old School Boards.</li>
	<img src="OldSkl.png" alt="Old School Boards" width="250" height="250"><br>
	Old School Boards come in the shape of a fishtail and are bigger than modern skateboards, excluding the smaller nose. The best feature to use to identify an Old
	Schoo board is the deck!
	<li style="font-family:Bungee Inline">Cruiser Boards</li>
	<img src="Cruiser.png" alt="Cruiser Board" width="300" height="250"><br>
	This type of skateboard can be made from any other type-just replace the wheels with softer ones! Bigger and softer wheels allow you to ride to a farther
	destination in a smaller amount of time.
	<li style="font-family:Bungee Inline">Longboards</li>
	<img src="Long.png" alt="Longboards" width="400" height="250"><br>
	Longboards are, quite simply put, long-boarded skateboards. They have soft wheels and are reliable. Their nature of being easy to ride because of a balanced
	structure makes them a good fit for beginners.
	<li style="font-family:Bungee Inline">Mini Cruisers</li>
	<img src="MC.png" alt="Mini Cruiser" width="250" height="300"><br>
	Mini Cruisers are the same size as Mini Boards but have softer and wider wheels. They are ,however, only for cruising, and may disappoint if used for doing tricks.
	<li style="font-family:Bungee Inline">Downhill Skateboards</li>
	<img src="Down.png" alt="Downhill Board" width="300" height="250"><br>
	Downhill Skateboards are for professionals and are designed for those who travel long distances. Downhill boards help the rider to achieve greater speeds without 
	any disruptions or wobbles.

<h2 style="font-size:90px"><u>Skate culture</h2></u>
<p>Skateboarding was popularized by the 1986 skateboarding cult classic Thrashin'. Directed by David Winters and starring Josh Brolin, it features 
appearances from many famous skaters such as Tony Alva, Tony Hawk, Christian Hosoi and Steve Caballero.</p>
<p>The increasing availability of technology is apparent within the skateboarding community. Many skateboarders record and edit videos of themselves and friends 
skateboarding. However, part of this culture is to not merely replicate but to innovate; emphasis is placed on finding new places and landing new tricks.</p>

	<li>According to a 2018 <i><b>Golobal News</i></b> article, Skateboarding put 637 Canadians in hospital-more than twice as many as football and rugby combined.
	Skateboarding was, however, not part of this article's 'top 5 sports and activities that land Canadians in the hospital'; it fell behind Cycling, Skiing and
	snowboarding, All terrain vehicles and others.</li>
	<li>There are 16-million skateboarders in the U.S., and more than twenty-million internationally (including the U.S.).</li>
	<li>The United States accounts for more than 50% of the total skateboarding market.</li>
